# GenAI Learning Metromap

> Welcome to the GenAI Learning Metromap! Navigating the field of GenAI can often feel daunting due to the interconnected concepts that require prior understanding. This guide aims to streamline the learning journey by mapping out these dependencies, helping to minimize cognitive overload. While there are numerous ways to structure such a learning path, this approach has worked for me. If you have ideas for improvement or alternative perspectives, I welcome your [feedbacks](mailto:spraja08@gmail.com). 

## Foundational

1. <span style="color:green">**MATH BASICS**</span>
   - *Linear Algebra:* Crucial for understanding deep learning algorithms. Key concepts include vectors, matrices, determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, vector spaces, and linear transformations
   - *Calculus:* Machine learning algorithms involve the optimization of continuous functions, which requires an understanding of derivatives, integrals, limits, and series. Multivariate calculus and the concept of gradients are also important.
   - *Probability and Statistics:* For understanding how models learn from data and make predictions. Key concepts include probability theory, random variables, probability distributions, expectations, variance, covariance, correlation, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, maximum likelihood estimation, and Bayesian inference.

<br><br>
2. <span style="color:green">**PROGRAMMING**</span>
   - *Python Basics:* A good understanding of the basic syntax, data types, error handling, and object-oriented programming.
   - *Data Science Libraries:* Includes NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
   - *Data Pre-processing:* Feature scaling and normalization, handling missing data, outlier detection, categorical data encoding, and splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.
   - *Machine Learning Libraries:* Scikit for traditional ML algos and Pytorch for Deeplearning. Understanding how to implement algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, k-nearest neighbours (K-NN), and K-means clustering is important. Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE are also helpful for visualizing high-dimensional data

3. <span style="color:green">**NEURAL NETS & LLM**</span>
   - *Nueral Net Fundamentals:* Components of a neural network such as layers, weights, biases, and activation functions (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, etc.)
   - *Training & Optimization:* Backpropagation and different types of loss functions, like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cross-Entropy. Understanding various optimization algorithms like Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, RMSprop, and Adam. Understanding the concept of overfitting (where a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data) and learn various regularization techniques (dropout, L1/L2 regularization, early stopping, data augmentation) to prevent it.
   - *Implementing MLPs:* Building a Multi Layer Perceptron, also known as a fully connected network, using PyTorch.
   - *LLM Overview & LLM-OS:*
