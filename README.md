# GenAI Learning Metromap

> Welcome to the GenAI Learning Metromap! This field is vast and often steep and discouraging because of the dependent concepts that needs to be learnt first. This guide is an attempt to help you navigate through the dependencies to reduce the cognitive overload. There are mental models toward structuring this journey. If you have a better one, please do share your [feedback](mailto:spraja08@gmail.com). 

## Foundational

1. <span style="color:green">**MATH BASICS**</span>
   - *Linear Algebra:* Crucial for understanding deep learning algorithms. Key concepts include vectors, matrices, determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, vector spaces, and linear transformations
   - *Calculus:* Machine learning algorithms involve the optimization of continuous functions, which requires an understanding of derivatives, integrals, limits, and series. Multivariate calculus and the concept of gradients are also important.
   - *Probability and Statistics:* For understanding how models learn from data and make predictions. Key concepts include probability theory, random variables, probability distributions, expectations, variance, covariance, correlation, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, maximum likelihood estimation, and Bayesian inference.

2. <span style="color:green">**PROGRAMMING**</span>
   - *Python Basics:* A good understanding of the basic syntax, data types, error handling, and object-oriented programming.
   - *Data Science Libraries:* Includes NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
   - *Data Pre-processing:* Feature scaling and normalization, handling missing data, outlier detection, categorical data encoding, and splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.
   - *Machine Learning Libraries:* Scikit for traditional ML algos and Pytorch for Deeplearning. Understanding how to implement algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, k-nearest neighbours (K-NN), and K-means clustering is important. Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE are also helpful for visualizing high-dimensional data
