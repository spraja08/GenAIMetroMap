## GenAI Scientists Path

### 4. LLM/SLM Foundations

Explore the core components that make Large Language Models work, from attention mechanisms to transformer architectures, the internal workings of modern language models and their sequence processing capabilities.

* **Multi-head Attention:** The attention mechanism allows a model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence when predicting outputs. In Transformers, the Scaled Dot-Product Attention is the core mechanism, where each token attends to every other token in the sequence, weighted by learned relevance scores.
* **Transformer Architecture:** The Transformer is a neural network architecture introduced in the [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper. It relies entirely on the attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. It eliminates recurrence and convolutions, allowing for parallelization and scalability in deep learning.
* **Output Sequence Generation:** In sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., language translation), the Transformer generates output tokens step-by-step using an autoregressive approach (predicting the next token based on previously generated tokens) or parallel decoding for some applications.
* **Tokenization:** The process of breaking down input text into smaller units (tokens), such as words, subwords, or characters. Models like GPT and BERT use subword tokenization (e.g., Byte Pair Encoding or WordPiece) to handle unknown words and reduce vocabulary size.

### 9. Evaluation

The metrics and methodologies for assessing language model performance, from traditional benchmarks to human evaluation frameworks.

* **Metrics**: Metrics like perplexity and BLEU score are not as popular as they were because they're flawed in most contexts. It is still important to understand them and when they can be applied.
* **General benchmarks**: Based on the [Language Model Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness), the [Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard) is the main benchmark for general-purpose LLMs (like ChatGPT). There are other popular benchmarks like [BigBench](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench), [MT-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685), etc.
* **Task-specific benchmarks**: Tasks like summarization, translation, and question answering have dedicated benchmarks, metrics, and even subdomains (medical, financial, etc.), such as [PubMedQA](https://pubmedqa.github.io/) for biomedical question answering.
* **Human evaluation**: The most reliable evaluation is the acceptance rate by users or comparisons made by humans. Logging user feedback in addition to the chat traces (e.g., using [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/capturing-feedback)) helps to identify potential areas for improvement.

### 10. Optimization

Optimization techniques that primarily optimizes memory usage, computational efficiency, and energy consumption. It is a critical method for deploying large models in resource-constrained environments and for scaling inference workloads efficiently.

* **Naive Quantization**: A basic form of model compression that uniformly reduces the numerical precision of all model weights (e.g., from 32-bit floating point to 8-bit integers) without considering the impact on model performance. While simple to implement, this approach can lead to significant accuracy degradation as it doesn't account for the varying sensitivity of different model components.

* **Quantization for CPUs**: A specialized quantization technique optimized for CPU inference that typically uses 8-bit integer (INT8) quantization. This approach includes careful calibration of scaling factors and zero points for each tensor, often utilizing techniques like per-channel quantization and dynamic range adjustment to maintain accuracy while leveraging CPU-specific optimizations.

* **Quantization for GPUs**: A GPU-specific quantization approach that focuses on maintaining computational efficiency while preserving model accuracy. It often employs techniques like FP16 (half-precision) or INT8 quantization with GPU-optimized kernels, and may include features like tensor core utilization and mixed-precision training to balance performance and accuracy.

* **Attention Aware Quantization**: A sophisticated quantization strategy that specifically targets attention mechanisms in transformer models. This method applies different quantization schemes to attention-related computations versus other model components, recognizing that attention layers are particularly sensitive to precision reduction. It often preserves higher precision for key attention operations while allowing more aggressive quantization elsewhere.

* **Distillation**: A model compression technique where a smaller model (student) is trained to mimic the behavior of a larger model (teacher). The student learns not just from the final outputs but also from the teacher's intermediate representations and attention patterns. This approach can significantly reduce model size while maintaining much of the original model's performance, making it particularly valuable for deployment in resource-constrained environments.
